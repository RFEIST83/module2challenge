Module 2 Challenge Read Me
----------------------------

As the dataset was extremely large to get the VBA script to run in under 5 minutes I needed to modify it using certain things to make it work faster and
more efficiently. To do this I had to research different ways of doing this.

Advanced Filter
--------------

I used this resource:

Scripting Dictionary
---------------------

I also used this resource to incorporate VBA dictionary to speed it up even further.

On top of this I also split the macro in to 4 different separate parts to avoid confusion.
